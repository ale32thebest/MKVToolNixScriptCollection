# MKVToolNixScriptCollection
a collection of simple windows (command prompt) script i actually use to manage my media files (mostly movies/tv shows)

DISCLAIMER: i am not responsible to your files, a misuse of these script may overwrite your media, pay attenction when you type something, also keep in mind that these script work with the idea that the "MKVToolNix" software is installed on you machine and its executables are already added to your PATH variable, a simple google search for "how to add a folder to my windows path" may clarify if you are not familiar with these concept
